On the Contact page, JavaScript was used in various places, both visible and not. JavaScript was used for the header (which contained the Navigation links) and footer, as it was with the other pages. This also has JavaScript elements that check for First Name and a valid E-mail address. If a name is not present, an alert will pop up. If an invalid e-mail has been entered, an alert will pop up and text will be displayed by the e-mail box showing what is needed. The Submit button also has JavaScript applied to it. Once all of the validation checks for the First Name and E-mail Address have been satisfied, the user can click the submit button and receive an alert that the submission was successful.
